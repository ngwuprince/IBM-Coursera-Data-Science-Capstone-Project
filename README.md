# IBM-Coursera-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
**Project background and context**
The aim is to build a machine learning system predicting the successful landing of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stages, crucial for cost-effective launches. This could aid competitors in bidding against SpaceX by estimating their launch costs based on the likelihood of first-stage reusability, a key factor in reducing expenses compared to other providers.

Problems you want to find answers:

1.What contributes to a successful rocket landing?
2.The interplay of different factors impacting the likelihood of a successful landing.
3.What conditions are necessary for a successful landing program's operation?
